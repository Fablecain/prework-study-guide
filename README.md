# Coding Study Guide Webpage


## Description

- My motivation for building this Coding Study Guide Webpage was to succeed in my coding career and be prepared for any future endeavors following my coding prework!

- I built this project to test my abilities as a future software engineer and to better understand the infastructure of what it means to be a web developer.

- This ultimately will solve the problem of solely relying on memory to get tasks done and gave me firsthand examples that better help me retain the information all at once!

- I learned that coding as a whole is a very hands-on activity. It is not something that you can just watch endless videos on and expect to be able to code.

- This study guide can be a perfect tool to reflect on some past topics that we may have forgotten!

- Things like HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git have all been summarized to help us better understand the things we may have had trouble with throughout the prework.

- Not only major topics but also smaller activities like understanding where variables belong when writing code and how to use them!
